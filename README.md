# Piiano Flows

**Application Data Privacy Through Code**

Gain visibility of the data flows, data risk and exposure, in a single click, by connecting your Github repository.
Unlike DSPM products, you can now be proactive and manage risk of leaking PII before it gets to production.

The Piiano Flows is a static code analyzer that connects to your online source code repository. It lets you track, reveal and learn about your application's sensitive data leaks, processing and sharing.

More details can be found [on our website](https://piiano.com/pii-code-scanner/).
